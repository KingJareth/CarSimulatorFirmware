# CarSimulatorFirmware 

CarSimulatorFirmware is the Open firmwares of VNM Simulation. It will have almost firmware for car simulator like wheelbase, pedal, shifter,...
Go to my discord to discuss about the firmwares and hardware: https://discord.gg/NDk4pYd
Or facebook group https://www.facebook.com/groups/2303223886447618/?ref=share

1. Wheelbase features:

- Support 12 effects and can adjust individually effect gains.
- Support build in DAC (PA4,PA5) ~ PE9,PE11 PWM
- change FFB frequency upto 4k (it can increase more but i think it is enough, it requires you have a high resolution encoder) the low resolution encoder should use low ffb frequency.
- configable Filters, user effects.

The feature roadmap for VNM Wheelbase Firmware includes:
* load cells with high resolution and  frequency
* 24 bit mutil channel ADC
* Angle sensors
* Absolute encoder
* Configure the servo driver from the GUI
* Displays configuration in LCD on-device
* Button for steering wheel, button box, paddles.


2. Shifter
- support hpattern and sequential mode
- use 2 analog input 
- Configable Led 
- support 2 button for truck knob
