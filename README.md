CarSimulatorFirmware is one of Open firmwares of VNM Simulation. Other Firmware and hardware are in the development phase.
Go to my discord to discuss about the firmware and hardware: https://discord.gg/NDk4pYd

This is the test version, It is tested by me and some friends in my discord. It works very well until now :). 
If you use MMOS, The wiring is the same. Read a document in rar file to know how to setup it.

Some it features:

- Support 12 effects and can adjust individually effect gains.
- Support telemetry ffb (only Assetto corsa at the moment, need time to add other game like ACC, Rally,...)
- It support analog output for AC servo drive, insteed of PE9, PE11 with external DAC, connect PA4 (~PE9), PA5(~PE11) to the AC Servo driver
